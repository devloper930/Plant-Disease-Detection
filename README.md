Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of plant diseases, including rust, scab, and others, as well as healthy plants. 
The model uses image classification techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze images of plant leaves and predict the presence of diseases.

Features
-Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification.
-Preprocesses images for training and prediction.
-Provides predictions for multiple disease categories and healthy plants.
-Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics.

Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
OpenCV
Matplotlib
PIL
tqdm

Usage-

Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess a dataset of plant images, separating them into disease categories and healthy plants.
Model Training: Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict diseases in new plant images.

Challenges-

Obtaining a diverse and representative dataset.
Dealing with the variation in plant disease symptoms.
Ensuring the model is scalable and efficient for real-world use.
Addressing the interpretability of the model's predictions.

Future Enhancements-

Incorporate IoT for real-time disease monitoring.
Expand the model to detect diseases in other types of plants.
Improve model interpretability for better user trust.
